# Task List

A simple task list that runs in the browser and saves tasks locally.

**Live:** [add URL after deploying to GitHub Pages]

---

## What it does

Add and delete tasks. Everything is saved to localStorage, so your tasks are still there when you reload the page.

---

## Getting started

### Requirements

- A browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge)
- Node.js 18+ (to run linting locally)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/task-list
cd task-list
npm install
```

### Configuration

No external services or environment variables required.

### Running the project

Open `index.html` directly in your browser. Or start a local server:

```bash
npx serve .
```
